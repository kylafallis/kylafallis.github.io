            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>Finding reliable long-term energy solutions remains a critical issue in addressing climate change. This experiment evaluated the potential for microbial fuel cells (MFCs) to generate electricity from household compost, providing a renewable energy source for an average U.S. family. MFCs utilize bacteria-driven organic matter decomposition to produce an electrical current. This project aims to optimize the current MFC system and integrate it into a lamp powered by the average family's organic waste. 
To begin, a comparative analysis was conducted on compost age, container size, and electrode material, size, and spacing. The most efficient conditions included compost aged 12-18 months, a 1L container, and carbon cloth electrodes spaced at 1 cm,  generating an average of 1.08 W. Additionally, a functional MFC-powered lighting system, the LYKA Lamp, was developed using a custom-built step-up DC converter and battery storage system. The lamp requires 11.95 hours to produce and store energy and then provides 2.43 hours of continuous light. An average U.S. family could maintain 3.11 LYKA lamps, leading to $128.76 in annual energy savings. In addition, about 45,000 lbs of CO2-equivalent emissions would be prevented per family yearly, demonstrating the economic and environmental benefits of decentralized MFC adoption. These findings highlight the potential of MFCs as a sustainable energy alternative, mitigating organic waste while offering a cost-effective and renewable power source.

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p>Test 1
Begin by collecting compost for a period of 2 weeks into a bucket. Such a source will most likely have plenty of anaerobic bacteria. Wait for compost to decompose, usually several months.
Drill one hole for copper wire on lids of containers. On one of the two lids, drill one hole for the air pump tube and one small hole for ventilation (this will not be sealed). Drill one hole on one side to both containers for the salt bridge. 
Prepare the electrodes by folding aluminum mesh a few times over and bind with large paper clips. Strip ends of copper wire and attach to both electrodes. Insert copper wire and air pump tube into drilled holes on lids. Seal with hot glue or caulk. 
Heat water over the stovetop and dissolve in as much salt as possible. Twist a long rope around itself to create a thicker rope. If necessary, cut the rope to approx. 15 cm. Soak the rope in the salt water. Once damp, wrap the rope in one layer of electrical tape and one duct tape, but keep the ends exposed. Insert each end of the salt bridge into the drilled holes on the sides of the containers. Seal with hot glue or caulk and extra tape as needed. 
Fill one container almost to the rim with sludge and the other with water. Submerge the electrodes into the sludge and water. Close the lids of the containers, and make sure the one over the sludge is airtight. Anaerobic bacteria should be exposed to as little oxygen as possible. 
Attach alligator clips to each loose end of copper wire. Clamp the alligator clips onto the voltmeter probes. Make sure the red probe is attached electrically to the electrode in the water. The black probe should connect to the electrode submerged in the sludge. 
Turn on the aquarium air pump. Turn the dial on the voltmeter to 20 VDC (can also be marked by the symbol, ) to measure the force of electricity moving through the circuit in terms of volts. Turn the dial to 2000m to measure it in terms of millivolts, a thousandth of a volt, to observe a more accurate reading. Turn the dial to 10A. This number is the flow of current the microbial fuel cell is generating, measured in amps. Then use the following formulas to calculate kWh and money saved. 
Total weight-weight of container=x→kgs→g. g/686=#of stacked fuel cells(y)
(Average energy(kWh)*abc)//(1.68(kWh/week for LED light bulbs)=LED lights powered/week
Test 2
For the second test, a modified MFC setup was created using a Tupperware container and a plastic sheet as a separator to evaluate the effect of different designs on energy output. Electrodes were prepared using aluminum mesh, graphite, and copper wire, and were assembled similarly to Test 1. Holes were drilled for the wire connections and salt bridge, and all pieces were secured with hot glue and waterproof tape.
Different types of compost, aged between six months to two years, were used as substrates to assess how decomposition stages influenced energy efficiency. Multiple trials were conducted using different organic materials, and the energy output was recorded with a voltmeter. The energy efficiency of this setup was compared to Test 1 to determine the best methods of energy collection.
Test 3
The final test involved constructing a functional MFC-powered lamp. The lamp body and MFC housing were designed using SolidWorks and 3D printed with ABA filament to ensure structural integrity. The MFC circuit was built with a four-diode configuration to enhance electron flow. Next, the custom AC step-up convertor was made with the battery storage components. Initially the negative and positive inputs were plugged into the bread board, with a capacitor as a reasonable strength in the same x-axis. Then jumper wires connecting to a buck power convertor module. The output wires are plugged into the opposite side of the breadboard, with output wires plugging into a TP4056 charger module. These wires need to be soldered on. From the opposite side, two wires connected to the OUT sections go to the lightbulb socket while two wires connected to the B section charge teh rechargeable battery. The components were connected on a breadboard using soldering techniques. An image included below shows the setup of the converter.
Once the circuit was complete, a 9V LED lightbulb was secured in a lightbulb socket and affixed to the lamp structure using a metal wire lampshade holder, nuts, and bolts. The screws were unscrewed and wires wrapped arround, then reattached. The software was then fitted into the MFC 3d-printed structure. Voltage and current outputs were measured to verify the circuit’s functionality. Finally, the lamp was tested by monitoring how long the LED bulb remained illuminated under different conditions.

It has a simple, low-cost design makes it accessible for all households, particularly in off-grid or energy-insecure areas. By refining the efficiency of MFCs and integrating them into common household devices, this technology could revolutionize small-scale renewable energy use.
Developed Nations: Reduce household energy costs and emissions.
Off-Grid Communities: Provides lighting where electricity is unavailable
Disaster Relief & Remote Areas: Reliable, low-cost energy for emergency.

This study shows that MFC technology is feasible for households and could play a key role in large-scale sustainability efforts, reducing energy costs and environmental impact.

Conclusion
The implementation of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) using household compost presents a promising opportunity for renewable energy production. If scaled to the  U.S. population, even at just 50%, MFCs could generate 4.76 billion kWh annually and offset over 409 million metric tons of CO₂ emissions, significantly contributing to national sustainability goals. At 100% adoption, these figures would double, greatly reducing reliance on fossil fuels.
While the weekly savings per household ($2.46) may seem small, widespread implementation could yield over $12 billion in national energy savings annually. This study shows that MFC technology is feasible for households and could play a key role in large-scale sustainability efforts, reducing energy costs and environmental impact.
