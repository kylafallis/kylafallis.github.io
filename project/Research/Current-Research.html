            <h3>Short Summary of Previous Research</h3>
            <p>This paper describes an experiment that successfully generates a continuous direct current (DC) voltage and current by rotating a specially designed conductor through Earth's magnetic field. This effect was previously thought to be impossible based on a simple proof.
The researchers achieved this by using a cylindrical shell made of manganese-zinc ferrite, a soft magnetic material. The material's properties and topology were specifically chosen to violate the assumptions of the original proof, allowing for the generation of electricity. The experiment confirmed several key predictions of the new theory, including:
-The voltage and current are at their maximum when the cylinder's axis is oriented orthogonally to both Earth's rotational velocity and magnetic field.
-The voltage reverses sign when the cylinder is rotated by 180 degrees.
-A solid cylinder of the same material and a high magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) cylindrical shell both failed to produce any voltage, further validating the specific conditions required for the effect.
The study's primary goal was to prove the existence of this predicted effect. The paper concludes by suggesting that future research could explore ways to scale up this effect to generate higher voltage and current.
            
            My goal is to recreate the results of this experiment and further it by testing different sized rods against energy output and some varying materials.</p>
