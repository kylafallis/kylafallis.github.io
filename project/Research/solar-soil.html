            <h3><strong><u>Abstract</u></strong></h3>
            <p>
                Solar panels are the leading source of renewable energy, but what are their effects on the environment? This project sought to determine the effect of solar panels on soil. I took two samples: the first was from my grandfather's land which will be contracted for a solar panel farm, and the second was from the Elida High School solar farm. After sending the samples to A & L Great Lakes Laboratories, Inc. for testing, the results indicated that <strong>solar panels do have a slight negative effect on soil quality.</strong>

            <h3><strong><u>Research Question & Hypothesis</u></strong></h3>

            <h4><strong>Question</strong></h4>
            <p>Do solar panels negatively affect soil quality, and is farmland viable after being used as a solar farm?</p>

            <h4><strong>Variables</strong></h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Independent:</strong> Presence of Solar Panels</li>
                <li><strong>Dependent:</strong> Soil quality metrics</li>
                <li><strong>Control:</strong> Farmland without solar panels</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><strong>Hypothesis</strong></h4>
            <p>Solar panels do not negatively affect soil composition.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3><strong><u>Methodology</u></strong></h3>
            <p>
                For this project, I identified two locations for soil sampling: a control site on my grandfather's farmland (pre-solar installation) and an active site at the Elida High School solar field (solar panels installed for ~2 years).
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Using a soil probe, I collected samples from approximately 8 inches deep at both locations.</li>
                <li>Each sample was carefully placed into a labeled plastic bag.</li>
                <li>The samples were then shipped to <strong>A & L Great Lakes Laboratories, Inc.</strong> for a comprehensive soil quality analysis.</li>
                <li>After a 7-day turnaround, I received the results and analyzed the data to compare the two sites.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3><strong><u>Results & Conclusion</u></strong></h3>

            <h4><strong>Data Analysis</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Upon reviewing the data, the soil quality from the Elida High School solar farm (N 40° 47' 26.7756" W 84° 11' 38.6664") was found to be lower across several key metrics compared to the soil from the control farmland (N 40° 55' 3.1188" W 84° 31' 48.8856").
            </p>
            <p>Key differences observed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organic Matter:</strong> 3.1% (solar farm) vs. 3.4% (farmland)</li>
                <li><strong>Phosphorus:</strong> 11 ppm vs. 29 ppm</li>
                <li><strong>Potassium:</strong> 99 ppm vs. 155 ppm</li>
                <li><strong>Magnesium:</strong> 285 ppm vs. 405 ppm</li>
                <li><strong>Calcium:</strong> 2100 ppm vs. 2300 ppm</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
            <p>
                My hypothesis that solar panels do not negatively affect soil quality was <strong>incorrect</strong>. The research shows that solar panels do have a slight negative effect on soil quality, as evidenced by the drop in key nutrients and organic matter. While the soil pH remained in the ideal 6-7.5 range, the overall nutrient density was lower. To increase confidence in these results, further testing with a larger sample size and chemical analysis for material leaching would be beneficial.

            <h3><strong><u>Impact of Research</u></strong></h3>
            <p>
                This project determined that solar panels do affect soil quality. The next logical step is to conduct chemical tests to determine if this is due to chemicals leaching from the panels themselves or a side effect of constant shade and altered land use. The ultimate goal would be to continue this research to help design safer installation methods, ensuring that land remains viable for farming after a solar contract is complete.
